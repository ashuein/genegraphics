	<p>Viewing and comparing gene neighborhoods is a common step in comparative genomics and gene analysis. We present, “Gene Graphics”, an application that allows for consistent, visually appealing representations of physical gene neighborhoods with minimal effort or expertise.</p>
	<p>Given a standard input file, “Gene Graphics” generates a default layout that is designed to be immediately usable. Within the graphical interface, users can customize colors, fonts, sizes, and positions of gene names, both individually and globally.</p>
	<p>Users may export images as portable network graphics (PNG) files or high-quality vector graphics (SVG) files. These accurate and visually appealing representations of gene neighborhood data can be easily imported into a publication or used to maintain a high-quality record.</p>
	<p>Gene Graphics was submitted to Bioinformatics, on XX/XX/XXXX.</p>
